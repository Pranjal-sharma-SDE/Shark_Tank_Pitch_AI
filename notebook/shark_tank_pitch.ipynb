Your Vocal Delivery Score of 52 is like a sedative; you are boring me to death. You need to wake up and make sure your pitch doesn't sound like it's directed at the walking dead.\n",

      "Now, let's dissect your business metrics. An Overall Viability Score of 62 is teetering on the edge of acceptability, I'll grant you that. Problem Clarity and Solution Viability are commendably high, but what on earth were you thinking with your Valuation? A big fat zero for The Ask? Are you trying to become the hero of a rags-to-riches story without ever actually asking for the riches? This is the kind of madness that will have you scratching for pennies like a cockroach under the fridge.\n",

You nailed the Problem Clarity with a score of 9 out of 10, and your Solution Viability is strong at 8 out of 10. This reflects a deep understanding of the problem you're trying to solve, which is crucial for any startup seeking investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are some glaring issues we need to address. First off, your Vocal Delivery Score of 52 out of 100 is concerning. Despite the emotional tone detection as 'Confident / Balanced', the frequent awkward silences and monotone delivery suggest otherwise. High hesitation shows a lack of preparation or perhaps nerves. We can't afford hesitation when pitching a business that aims to transform such a critical area.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the most crucial red flag here is the absence of financial details or investment requests. This essentially translates to a zero in your valuation ask. You can't walk into the tank without a clearly defined ask; it's like showing up to a game without a strategy. I need to know what you're seeking from us, not just in terms of money, but how you plan to use it to address this enormous gap in women's healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solution Viability and Problem Clarity are strong points for you, but without a concrete financial plan or an investment request, it's hard to evaluate the business potential. You need to regroup, define your financial strategy, and come back with a clear, compelling ask.\"\n",
